A Multitool.
The Idea was to automate the use of github repos with the press of a button.
- Osint Tools
- Darkweb Scraping
- Password Tools
- Attack Tools
- Exploit and recon tools
- Data Leak Tools
- Sock Puppet Tools
- + a lot more.
  + All in all contains over 200 useful repo's and programs I made.
